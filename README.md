# E-learning-Website


### WHAT IS E-LEARNING?

A learning system based on formalised teaching but with the help of electronic resources is known as E-learning. While teaching can be based in or out of the classrooms, the use of computers and the Internet forms the major component of E-learning. E-learning can also be termed as a network enabled transfer of skills and knowledge, and the delivery of education is made to a large number of recipients at the same or different times. Earlier, it was not accepted wholeheartedly as it was assumed that this system lacked the human element required in learning.
 

### WHY CHOOSE E-LEARNING WEBSITE AS PROJECT TOPIC?


We as computer science students saw the need for an online platform where a CSE or any student who wishes to learn different programming languages like Java ,C ,C++ ,Python etc and even execute code through the online compiler that we included into our website to make it more helpful.

### METHODOLOGY


The following are the programming languages we used to create our website:

1.	HTML

Html was used to create the basic layout of our website. Html is used to create the structure and put up the content of the website.
Inside the <body> element of our web site we used our "Layout " and created:
*	A navigation bar
*	A slide show
*	A header
*	Some sections and articles
*	A footer

2.	CSS 

It allows you to develop the overall look of your website. While HTML focuses on the content and structure of a website, CSS is concerned with elements of presentation such as layout, font and colour. 
The most essential function of CSS which makes it so integral to web design is its focus on layout over content
CSS is that it allows the same page to be rendered differently in different mediums such as print, on screen or even tactile devices. It also supports aural style sheets, which means it decides how a document will sound when rendered in speech.
For the designing of our website we used CSS

3.	JAVASCRIPT

JavaScript, an object scripting language which is used in web pages along with markup language HTML. JavaScript is very popular and adopted universally by every web browser for its support which allows dynamic content to get execute in a webpage. JavaScript does not incorporate or abide by any HTML tags or rules. 
Javascript was used in quiz page where using funcitons and selection statements we corrected our quiz forms answers by our users.

4.	PHP

Php was used in the coding of the online compiler as well as in the login / sign up pages along with the different forms used in our website.


5.	BOOTSTRAP

Bootstrap is a free front-end framework for faster and easier web development
Bootstrap includes HTML and CSS based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, tables, navigation, modals, image carousels and many other, as well as optional JavaScript plugins
Bootstrap also gives you the ability to easily create responsive designs
In our website we mainly used bootstrap in our homepage.

6.	jQUERY

jQuery is a JavaScript library that helps to simplify and standardize interactions between JavaScript code and HTML elements. JavaScript allows websites to be interactive and dynamic, and jQuery is a tool that helps streamline that process.

In our website we have used jQuery to create animations in our homepage. The slideshow animation is coded in jQuery.

### SCOPE FOR IMPROVEMENT


The website could have study material for many programming languages which were not included in our website. Currently only java ,C,C++ was included but languages like python, html, CSS, javascript, Csharp etc could be included.
Also instead of making the website only student interactive , we could include teacher interaction where teachers can upload their own study material and conduct tests to enhance the learning experience.
Our online compiler could include compiling for many more languages.
